    <p class="main-paragraph">Katsushika Hokusai was born on October 31, 1760, and died on May 10th, 1849 at the young
        age of 88. Hokusai began painting around the age of six and they thing he learned from his father. During his
        life Hokusai was sent to work at a library at the age of 12 by his father, after being there for a year he
        became a pupil and his master gave him the name of Shunro and under this name he published his first prints and
        a series of pictures of Kabuki actors that was published in 1779. Years later he married his first wife and very
        little was known about her except that she passed away in the early 1790s and 7 years later he remarried but
        unfortunately his second wife passed away shortly afterward. He is the father of two sons and three daughters
        with the two wives and his youngest daughter Ei, also known as Oi, became an artist as well. Later in his life,
        Hokusai developed many brush paintings called surimono, and illustrations for Kyoka ehon (humorous poems).</p>
