        <p>The Great Wave off Kanagawa or simply put "The Wave" was published somewhere between 1829 and 1833 and is the
            first print of Hokusai's series "Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji" It is also one of Hokusai's most famous
            works and the most recognizable works of Japanese art in the world. As you can see in the picture and the
            title, it is a giant wave off the coast of Kanagawa while seeing Mount Fuji in the background. This print is
            a yoko-e, which is a style of a woodblock print and painting meaning it's in landscape format. The final
            sketch is taken to a Hiroshi, block carver, who then glues thin washi paper, type of Japanese paper, to the
            block which is usually cherry, then carefully carves away to form a relief of the lines of the image, from
            there the drawing is lost. A surishi, or printer, places printing paper on each block and rubs the back with
            a hand tool known as a baren and once finished you have the print. Doing this usually allows for a few
            thousands of prints before the woodblock is worn out and not able to produce any more paintings.</p>
